# Visualizing-US-School-Shootings-Data
I sourced data from GitHub on US Shootings collated by The Washington post. I used this data to plot a static choropleth map and several interactive maps to visualize this data. I used libraries and packages such as altair, pandas, geopandas, openstreetmaps and folium to create these maps. 
This contains heatmaps, choropleth map, cluster map with filters, point map. I used open street maps to find the nearest hospital to the location of the worst shooting incidence.
